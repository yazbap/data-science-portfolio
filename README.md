- **higher_education_disparities:** In this research, I delve into the landscape of research institutions across the United States. Focusing particularly on Ivy League universities, I scrutinize the multifaceted elements influencing their standings as evaluated by the Shanghai Ranking Consultancy (SRC). Through this analysis, I aim to cast a critical eye on the validity of the ranking systems employed by organizations such as the SRC. Moreover, I seek to provoke thoughtful discourse on the factors that ought to be considered, or conversely, disregarded in the determination of institutional rankings.

- **revert_data:** As part of a computer programming course, I analyzed reverts on Wikipedia. A revert occurs when an editor undoes the changes made by another editor. I identified who reverted whom and when, the situations in which if $A$ reverted $B$, $B$ reverted $A$ within 24 hours, and finally, studied the difference in seniority between $A$ and $B$

- **ML_optimization_techniques:** In this project, I employed advanced machine learning techniques through algorithmic refinement and predictive modeling, I demonstrated proficiency in optimization, model selection, and predictive analytics to answer a series of questions including forecasting the onset of civil war to underscore the practical applications of machine learning in bolstering global peacekeeping efforts.

- **voter_turnout_behavior:** In preparation for the 2024 US presidential election, I developed an individual-level voter turnout prediction model for a non-partisan advocacy group using the Cooperative Election Study data. The model identifies individuals less likely to vote, enabling efficient resource allocation to encourage voter participation. I balanced model complexity and performance to ensure accuracy and cost-effectiveness within budget constraints, considering various predictor variables and evaluating trade-offs. The project culminated in a detailed report on the modeling strategy, expected performance metrics, and suitability for the organizationâ€™s goals, demonstrating my data science skills, strategic thinking, and effective communication in a policy-driven context. Data can be provided upon request.
